  Apache Labs:  Radiant 'Members' Extension
=============================================

Updated to work with Radiant 0.8.0


Enhances the Radiant users model for use as a site-wide members
feature.  It makes the following changes:

The User model now has a:

- photo  (file_column)
- url

The `User#login` field is replaced with the `User#email` field on
validation.  Users are expected to login with their email address
instead of another login username.

A new `Profile` tab is added.  This becomes the default tab on login.
A new Snippet named `profile_sidebar` is created which can be used to
modify the profile page.

All tabs except for Profile now default to require :developer or
:admin role access.  This includes the Page and Snippets tabs.

A new registration form will be created at:

    /admin/members/new

A password recovery form is added at:

   /admin/forgot_password



INSTALL
-------

To install:

   ./script/extension install members

Or

   svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/consite/trunk/members vendor/extensions/members
   rake radiant:extensions:members:migrate
   rake radiant:extensions:members:update

The extension includes a copy of the file_column plugin.

Be sure to change the hard coded links and site name in the forgot
password mailer.  See:

    app/models/password_mailer.rb
    app/views/password_mailer/*.erb

If you want to use the password mailers, you'll need to activate
ActionMailer in your `config/environments.rb` and setup ActionMailer
as needed.



TODO
----

There's *lots* still to be done, including:

 - Linking to the registration page on the login page
 - Registration email confirmation
 - Admin registration moderation
 - RSpec tests
