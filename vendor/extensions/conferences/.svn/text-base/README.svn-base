 Apache Labs: Radiant 'Conferences' Extension
==============================================

This extension for the Radiant CMS includes models, forms and tags for
managing a multi-track conference website.  It was originally written
to support ApacheCon and may still contain several ApacheCon specific

## Conference Model ##

 A Conference has one Venue with one or more Locations and one or more
 Tracks associated with a Location.  Users create Presentations which
 are submitted as Submissions to a Conference.  Submissions can then
 be approved and scheduled, becoming Scheduled Sessions associated
 with a Track in the Conference.  Activities are scheduled events
 associated with a Conference (and optionally a Track) that may have
 no associated User (such as a lunch or break).  Finally,
 Organizations can become Sponsors of a Conference.


 INSTALL
---------

  ./script/extension install conferences

or 

   svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/consite/trunk/conferences vendor/extensions/conferences
   rake radiant:extensions:conferences:migrate
   rake radiant:extensions:conferences:update

The update task will copy a version of the 'active_scaffold' plugin
into your root vendor/plugins directory.  This is due to the way
active_scaffold looks up files and templates.


The following other extensions are recommended:
  
  - members
  - tiny_mce_filter
  - page_attachments
  - mailer
  - sns

 TODO
------

- the 'conference_roles' view doesn't seem to be created properly in
  some MySQL installs.  You may need to create it manually.  See
  migration #34.

- The current set of migrations need refactored to work for a clean install
- RSpec tests need written
- Replace ActiveScaffold with custom, better designed forms
